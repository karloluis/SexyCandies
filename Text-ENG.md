## About

Sexy Candies came to be in February 2004 due to the sweet cravings of coworkers and the need of extra income. (NAME) started with the basics, 

chocolate covered marshmallows, and then came the chocolate covered strawberry craze! 

Later on she concocted her own creations like assorted chocolate covered fruits topped with nuts as well as client specifications.

The "sexy" comes from the appealing decorations on the chocolates, a chocolate covered strawberry is not the same as a Sexy Candies chocolate covered strawberry,

 showered with sprinkles and edible glitter, both delectble to the eye and to taste!


 At a young age, (NAME) took basic baking classes every Wednesday for six months and it enkindled what has been since one of her greatest passions. 

 Although she did not pursue it at the time, she would always volunteer to create a sweet and delicious masterpiece for every special occasion, and did it with passion and care.

 Now she bakes all kinds of cakes, cr√®mes, mousses, and sweets to the client's desires.
